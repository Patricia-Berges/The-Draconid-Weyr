# The-Draconid-Weyr
Personal python-based text game about managing and building a story of a group of draconids. Make important decisions for the group as it grows -or falls to its extinction-, find other species and follow each individual since their birth to their decease, left to the hands of fate.

# Important!
The game is in the very early stages of development - it's not nearly prepared to be played yet. 

# Technologies
So far, the game is entirely based on python, using pygame and a sql database for save data.
